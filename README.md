## Complete Screen Saver Module \(Update\)


</div>

### Description

This module was designed because I noticed although a lot of people posted some amazing Screen Savers graphically, they weren't as functional as those that are included with Windows. Add them to this Module I wrote and you will be able to view previews, save passwords, anything a regular Screen Saver does.

UPDATE (Feb 2002): This application has been updated to allow WINNT based users to run the program without crashing. Thanks for the feedback.
 
### More Info
 
Heavily commented so that even a beginner could understand and implement it.
